# Deciphering the Mutation Spectrum in South Indian Children With Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract
<font size=4>

### Hypothesis/Research question
- Can NGS based customized targeted gene panel be used for genetic diagnosis of CAKUT. <br  >
- What is estimated ‘monogenic burden’ in south Indian children with CAKUT. <br  >

### Findings

- Cohort of the size 110 patients and 69 of these patients were genotyped  <br  >  

  
| Phenotype | % representation |
| --- | --- |
| posterior urethral valve (PUV) | 39.1 % |
| vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) | 33.3 % |
| multi-cystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) | 7.2 % |




- Diagnotic yeild in the study is 3% which is within reported diagnostic range (2–15%) obtained in some studies that used targeted panel sequencing <br  >  

  
| Phenotypes | % representation |
| --- | --- |
| posterior urethral valve (PUV) | 39.1 % |
| vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) | 33.3 % |
| multi-cystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) | 7.2 % |

### Samples Sequenced
Total Number of Patients Screened: **110** <br>
Total Number of Patients Samples sequenced : **69** <br>
                                        

### Workflow 

<img src='images/workflow.jpg'>

<font size=4>

- Patients and clinical data:<br>
 Children diagnosed with CAKUT (age group: newborn -18 years). Clinical data, laboratory and imaging details were documented
<br>

- Next generation sequencing: <br>
 Customized CAKUT NGS panel sequencing using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine sequencer
<br>

- NGS data analysis: <br>
 Variants were filtered and classified according to the workflow
<br>
